I have 3 years of experience in the field of automation testing.
I have been working as a software quality engineer in infosys, 
where my responsibilities are to develop and enhance the script as per the client need.
As a QA I have developed a skill in data migration testing where I have develop skill in etl and selenium testing.
I hold a bit degree in eec from BCET in 2021.

I am really excited about the job role and I think my skill are relevant to this rule and definitely I will contribute my best.
